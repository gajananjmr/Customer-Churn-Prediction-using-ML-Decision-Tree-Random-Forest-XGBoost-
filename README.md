# Customer-Churn-Prediction-using-ML-Decision-Tree-Random-Forest-XGBoost-
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning models. We train and evaluate multiple models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost using cross-validation techniques. The goal is to identify customers likely to leave a service and take proactive actions.
